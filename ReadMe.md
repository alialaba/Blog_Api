      "body": "A while ago, I got to think about the term “Designing in the browser” and if it’s a valid thing at all. The term “designing” in the browser indicates that we can add design elements quickly, but if we compare that to a design tool, like Figma, then the tool will win in terms of speed. When we have an already implemented design in the browser, then it’s so much easier to tweak it, and eventually, we might “design” something different from what we started with. I like the term “tweaking” better for that context. The question is, what do we need to be able to design in the browser? And what we can do in the browsers with the current developer tools? Introduction The term “designing in the browser” is so vague to the point that some designers and developers think that web browsers are design tools. This thinking implies that if we have an HTML markup, then we can start designing in the browser, just like a design tool (e.g: Figma). No, that’s not the point! Let’s take the following example for a recipes website. We have the following sections: header search featured recipes recipes listingand so on.Can we design the following in the browser at the same time we do it in a design tool?",
